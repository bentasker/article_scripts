# Article Scripts

This repo is intended to hold a range of different scripts/implementations.

It provides a single central location to store copies of miscellaneous scripts written for blog posts etc when there's no better home for them.

Things that are better placed elsewhere (like Telegraf Plugins) will still go [into the relevant repo](https://github.com/bentasker/telegraf-plugins)

### Repo Structure

The structure should be as follows

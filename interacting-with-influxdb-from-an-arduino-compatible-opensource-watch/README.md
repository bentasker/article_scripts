# Modified `7_SEG` Watchface for Watchy

This is a full copy of the code referred to in [Linking my Watchy Open Source Watch to InfluxDB](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/software-development/interacting-with-influxdb-from-an-arduino-compatible-opensource-watch.html).

It's a fork of the SQFMI's [`7_SEG` Watchface](https://github.com/sqfmi/Watchy/tree/master/examples/WatchFaces/7_SEG), amended to read and write metrics from [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb).

Like [the original](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/license/) the code is released under [MIT License](7_SEG/LICENSE.txt)

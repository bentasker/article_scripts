# Hot Tub Monitoring Dashboard

This is a copy of the Grafana dashboard referred to in my article [Automating a Hot Tub with Home Assistant](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/house-stuff/automating-our-hottub-with-home-assistant.html).

It makes a few assumptions

* You're using the [`ha-bestway`](https://github.com/cdpuk/ha-bestway) HomeAssistant Addon
* You have HomeAssistant configured to write states into an InfluxDB database called `home_assistant`
* You have a single hot-tub which shows up with the default entity name `spa`
